TeamCity has two main modes: __Home__ and __Settings__. The __Home__ mode accumulates build results at a project or build configuration level. If you are using the new TeamCity UI, you can navigate between this hierarchy via the Projects sidebar. Whenever you click a particular build on any __Home__ page, TeamCity will show this build's __Build Results__ page.  
Each mode has its own level of detail: to see the build statistics for the whole project, go to __Project Home__; to browse the details of a single build, go to its __Build Results__.

This section contains articles explaining how you can use these modes to browse build results in TeamCity. Refer to the sidebar to see its contents.
