TeamCity has two main modes: __Home__ and __Settings__. The __Home__ mode accumulates build results at a project and build configuration levels. If you are using the new TeamCity UI, you can navigate between this hierarchy via the _Projects_ sidebar.

Each mode has its own level of detail. To see the build statistics for the whole project, go to __Project Home__:

To browse the details of a single build configuration, click its name to open its __Build Configuration Home__:

Whenever you click a particular build on any __Home__ page, TeamCity will show this build's __Build Results__:
