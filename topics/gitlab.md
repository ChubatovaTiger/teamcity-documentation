TeamCity integration with the GitLab issue tracker can be set up separately or as a part of TeamCity integration with the [GitLab source code hosting service](integrating-teamcity-with-vcs-hosting-services.md#Integrating+TeamCity+with+GitLab). 

Configure connection with GitLab as described [here](configuring-connections.md#GitLab). When setting up integration with GitLab issues (see general information [here](integrating-teamcity-with-issue-tracker.md#Enabling+Issue+Tracker+Integration)), in addition to the repository URL and other general settings, you need to configure authentication and specify the issue ID pattern.
