[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Viewing Users and User Groups)

You can view the list of users and user groups registered in the system on the __Administration | Users__ and __Administration | Groups__ pages. The content of these pages depends on your server's [authentication settings](configuring-authentication-settings.md) and TeamCity edition. For example, user accounts search and assigning roles are not available in TeamCity Professional.

The top search panel allows you to quickly find users:
* In the _Find_ field, you can specify a search string, which can be a user visible name, full name, email address, or a part of it.
* To narrow down the search, you can also restrict it to a particular user group, role, or role in a specific project. By selecting the _Invert roles filter_ option, you can invert search results to show the list of users that do not have the specified role assigned.
