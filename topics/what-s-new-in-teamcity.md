## 2FA: Additional Verification for Critical Edits

Starting with version 2023.05, users who pass the two-factor authentication have one hour to perform security-related actions (disable 2FA, change user passwords, set up external OAuth accounts, generate access tokens, and so on). Once this period expires, users must re-confirm their identities and pass a new 2FA checkup before they can proceed with these edits.

This new behavior adds an extra layer of protection for your TeamCity server, and is another reason why you should always opt for enabling 2FA for users with elevated access permissions.
