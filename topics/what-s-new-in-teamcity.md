## Build reordering is supported by the Sakura UI

You can now manually reorder builds in the build queue by dragging them to the desired position in the Sakura UI.

## Amazon EC2 Launch Templates customization

Starting from this version, TeamCity allows customizing [Amazon EC2 launch templates](setting-up-teamcity-for-amazon-ec2.md#Amazon+EC2+Launch+Templates+support). You can now use the same launch template to run various instances that differ in some parameters only.
Check the **Customize Launch Template** box and modify the launch template's values as required.
