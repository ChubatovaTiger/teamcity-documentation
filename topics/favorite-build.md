## Adding Builds to Favorites

To manually add a build to your favorites, use the appropriate option from the __Actions__ menu on the __[Build Results](working-with-build-results.md)__ page. Your favorite build will be marked with a star symbol ![star_filled.png](star_filled.png).

To add multiple builds to favorites at once, open the __Overview__ tab of the __Build Configuration Home__ page, select the required builds (checkboxes appear when hovering over  builds), and click __Add to favorites__ in the pop-up context menu. Note that to select a range of builds, you can press `Shift` and click build checkboxes at the edges of the range to be selected.  

Any of your manually triggered builds and [personal builds](personal-build.md) can be added to your favorites automatically if you enable the corresponding setting in your [user profile settings](configuring-your-user-profile.md).

You can also add a custom build to favorites by checking the [corresponding box](running-custom-build.md#Comment+and+Tags).

## Viewing Your Favorites

To view your favorites, in the top right corner of the TeamCity web UI, click the arrow next to your username, and select __My Favorite Builds__.

You can also configure notifications on your favorite builds using the appropriate link on this page.

## Configuring Notifications on Your Favorite Builds

When [subscribing to notifications](adding-notification-rules.md), you can limit notifications on the selected watched projects or build configurations to your favorite builds only.
