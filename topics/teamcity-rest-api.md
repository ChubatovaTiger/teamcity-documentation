TeamCity provides a REST API for integrating external applications and creating script interactions with the TeamCity server. It allows accessing resources via URL paths.

You can start working with the REST API by opening the `http://<TeamCity Server host>:<port>/app/rest/server` URL in your browser: this page gives several pointers to explore the API.
