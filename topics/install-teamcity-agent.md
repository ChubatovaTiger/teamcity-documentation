Before installing a TeamCity build agent, make sure to read the [system requirements](system-requirements.md#TeamCity+Agent+Requirements).

Choose a convenient installation option:
* using an [installer](#Install+from+Windows+Executable+File) on Windows
* [installing manually from a ZIP file](#Install+from+ZIP+File) on any platform
* preparing a Docker container based on the [official TeamCity Agent image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-agent/)

## Install from Windows Executable File

1. Open the __Agents__ page in TeamCity.
2. Click __Install Build Agents__ and select _Windows Installer_ to download the installer.
3. On the agent machine, run `agentInstaller.exe` and follow the installation instructions.

Ensure that the user account used for running the agent service has proper [permissions](system-requirements.md#Common+Requirements).

## Install from ZIP File

1. Make sure that the `JRE_HOME` or `JAVA_HOME` environment variables are set on the agent machine and respectively point to the installed JRE or JDK directories.
2. Open the __Agents__ page in TeamCity.
3. Click __Install Build Agents__ and select one of the two options to download the archive:  
    * __Minimal ZIP file distribution__: a regular build agent with no plugins.
    * __Full ZIP file distribution*__: a full build agent prepacked with all plugins currently enabled on the server.
4. Extract the downloaded file into an arbitrary directory.
5. Open the `<installation path>\conf` directory and rename the `buildAgent.dist.properties` file to `buildAgent.properties`.
6. Edit the `buildAgent.properties` file to specify the TeamCity server URL (HTTPS is recommended, see [these notes](install-and-start-teamcity-agents.md#Agent-Server+Data+Transfer)), the name of the agent, and the [authentication token](install-and-start-teamcity-agents.md#Generating+Authentication+Token). Refer to [this article](configure-agent-installation.md) for details on the agent configuration.

Refer to [this article](configure-agent-installation.md) for details on the agent configuration.

On Linux, you may need to give execution permissions to the `bin/agent.sh` shell script.

On Windows, you may want to install the [build agent Windows service](start-teamcity-agent.md#Build+Agent+as+Windows+Service) instead of using the manual agent startup.

<tip>

__\*__ A __minimal TeamCity agent__ distribution does not contain plugins: the agent downloads them on the first start. The __full agent__ contains all enabled plugins and automatically stays relevant with the current TeamCity server state. This makes its distribution archive larger but significantly reduces the time spent on the first agent run.

The full agent is the most convenient if you use scripts for creating agent images (for example, [in cloud](agent-cloud-profile.md)). All instances will be synchronized with the server from the start and can instantly run a build.

Note that after starting, the full agent behaves like a regular agent. If you modify the state of plugins on the TeamCity server, all active agents will need to restart to synchronize with the server.

## Install via Agent Push

TeamCity provides the Agent Push functionality that allows installing a build agent to a remote host. Supported combinations of the server host platform and targets for build agents:
* From a Unix-based TeamCity server, build agents can be installed to Unix hosts only (via SSH).
* From a Windows-based TeamCity server, build agents can be installed to Unix (via SSH) or Windows (via psexec) hosts.

<note>

__SSH note__

Make sure the "Password" or "Public key" authentication is enabled on the target host according to your preferred authentication method.
</note>

### Remote Host Requirements

There are several requirements for the remote host:

Linux

* Installed JDK (JRE) 8-11. The JVM should be reachable via the `JAVA_HOME` (`JRE_HOME`) global environment variable or be in the global path (instead of being specified in, for example, user's `.bashrc` file).
* The `unzip` utility.
* Either `wget` or `curl`.

* Installed JDK/JRE 8-11.
* `Sysinternals psexec.exe` has to be installed on the TeamCity server and accessible in paths. You can install it in __Administration | Tools__. Note that [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) applies additional requirements to a remote Windows host. Make sure the following preconditions are satisfied:
    * [Administrative share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_share) on a remote host is enabled and accessible.
    * Remote services work (MMC snap-in can connect to the machine).
    * Remote registry works (`regedit` can connect to the machine via `services.msc`).
    * Server and workstation services are running (check via `services.msc`).
    * [Classic network authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-access-sharing-and-security-model-for-local-accounts) is enabled.

You can test the connection by the following commands:
  ```Console
    net use \\target\Admin$ /user:Administrator 
    dir \\target\Admin$ 
   ```

### Installation

Note that to access the __Agent Push__ page, a user needs to have the _Administer build agent machines_ permission.

1. In the TeamCity UI, open __Agents | Agent Push__ and click __Install Agent__.   
   If you want to use the same settings for several target hosts, you can __create a preset__ with these settings and use it each time when installing an agent to another remote host.
2. In the _Install agent_ dialog, either select a saved preset or choose "_Use custom settings_", specify the target host platform, and configure corresponding settings. Agent Push to a Linux system via SSH supports custom ports (the default is 22) specified as the _SSH port_ parameter. The port specified in a preset can be overridden in the host name (for example, `hostname.domain:2222`), during the actual agent installation.
3. You may need to download `Sysinternals psexec.exe`, in which case you will see the corresponding warning and a link to __Administration | Tools__ where you can download it.

>You can use Agent Push presets in [Agent Cloud profile](agent-cloud-profile.md) settings to automatically install a build agent to a started cloud instance.
