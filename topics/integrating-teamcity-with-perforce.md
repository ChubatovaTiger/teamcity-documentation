This article describes how to integrate TeamCity with [Perforce Helix Core](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core) to:

* Build sources of projects stores in a Helix Core repository.
* 

## Prerequisites

* A Perforce Helix Core client must be installed on the TeamCity server machine.
{product="tc"}
* The path to the Perforce client must be added to the `PATH` environment variable.  
  Alternatively, a full path to `p4` could be set via the [internal property](server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+Internal+Properties) `teamcity.perforce.customP4Path`. The property value must include the `p4` filename.
{product="tc"}
* If you plan to use the [agent-side checkout mode](vcs-checkout-mode.md#agent-checkout), you need to install a Perforce Helix Core client and add it to `PATH` on build agent machines as well.

## Run Builds on Perforce Helix Core Sources

To be able to run builds on project sources stored in Perforce Helix Core, you need to perform two procedures:
1. Create a dedicated project in TeamCity:
   1. Go to __Administration | Projects__ and click __Create project__.  
      Note that this will add the project right under the _Root project_. Alternatively, you can add it under any other existing project.
   2. Enter the _Name_ and _ID_ of the project.
   3. Click __Create__.
2. Create a Perforce VCS root:
   1. In the __Project Settings__, go to __VCS Roots__.
   2. Click __Create VCS root__.
   3. Choose _Perforce Helix Core_ as a VCS type.
   4. Configure the settings as described in [this article](perforce.md).

After the project and Perforce root are configured, you can proceed with [adding build configurations](creating-and-editing-build-configurations.md) and running builds.

## View Build Details

### View Perforce Jobs

If a build contains a changelist that is associated with one or more [jobs](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/p4guide/Content/P4Guide/chapter.jobs.html), TeamCity will show a wrench icon ![wrench.png](wrench.png) next to this change in the build results. Click or hover it to view the details of the relevant jobs.

## Perforce Logs
{product="tc"}

All operations of the Perforce plugin are logged in to the `teamcity-vcs.log` files with the category `jetbrains.buildServer.VCS.P4` (on an agent or on a server, depending on the operation mode). The detailed logging can be enabled with [TeamCity Server Logs](teamcity-server-logs.md).

## Perforce Workspace Handling in TeamCity

Refer to a [separate page](perforce-workspace-handling-in-teamcity.md).

## Perforce Streams as feature branches

Refer to a [separate page](perforce-streams-as-feature-branches.md).

## Running Builds on Perforce Shelved Files

Since version 2021.2, you can [manually run](running-custom-build.md#P4-shelved-files-custom-run) or [automatically trigger](perforce-shelve-trigger.md) builds on Perforce shelved files.

If you use [Perforce Helix Swarm](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-swarm) for code reviews, you can also [configure TeamCity to posts build statuses](commit-status-publisher.md#Perforce+Helix+Swarm) as comments to your reviews.
