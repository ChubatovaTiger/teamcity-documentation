[JetBrains Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/) is a full-cycle collaboration solution for software development teams. This guide explains how to achieve continuous integration and delivery of JetBrains Space projects by integrating them with TeamCity.

Integration with TeamCity brings the following advantages to the JetBrains Space users:
* Compiling, testing, and deploying projects within the same environment.
* Building source code of pull requests, with the ability to merge sources automatically after a successful build.
* Extensive build overview: diffs and artifacts, detailed test reports on-the-fly, code coverage, inspections, and various other metrics.
* Flexible pipelines where builds depend on one another and share settings and results.
* Ability to configure builds as code, in Kotlin DSL.
* Cross-shared statuses of builds and code reviews between these solutions, for easier monitoring.
* Authentication with a single account in both systems: VCS (Space) and CI/CD (TeamCity).

To perform all the described steps, you need to have:
* Administrative access to either the [TeamCity Cloud](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/signup/) instance or [TeamCity On-Premises](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/) server of your organization.
* Administrative access to the JetBrains Space instance of your organization.

If you only want to integrate JetBrains Space repositories with TeamCity projects, having project administration rights will be enough.

## Building Sources of JetBrains Space Repository

There are three ways to integrate a JetBrains Space repository with TeamCity:
* Create a TeamCity project based on a repository.
* Create a build configuration based on a repository in an existing TeamCity project.
* Create a VCS root based on a repository in an existing TeamCity project.

We will describe the first approach as it the most popular and self-sufficient. However, you can always add one more Space [root](configuring-vcs-roots.md) or [build configuration](creating-and-editing-build-configurations.md#Creating+Build+Configuration+from+URL) to an existing project â€” tne procedure is similar.

This approach involves two steps: (1) creating a connection preset to your Space instance and (2) creating a TeamCity project from a Space repository URL.

### Create Connection Preset

>TeamCity allows you to configure all settings of your _connection_ to VCS in one place and then reuse these settings in different projects and build configurations. If you add such a _connection_ on the <emphasis tooltip="root-project">Root project</emphasis> level, this will allow using its settings to connect any other project on the server. To make a connection available only in a certain project, you need to add it in this project.  
>You can configure as many connections as you want.
