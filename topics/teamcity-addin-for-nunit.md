<note>

TeamCity NUnit Add-in supports __NUnit prior to version 3.0__. For later versions, refer to the [this section](nunit-for-msbuild.md).
</note>

If you run NUnit tests via the [NUnit console](http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=nunit-console&amp;r=2.2.10) and want TeamCity to track the test results without having to launch the TeamCity test runner, the best solution is to use TeamCity Add-in for NUnit. You can plug this addin into NUnit, and the tests will be automatically reported to the TeamCity server.

Alternatively, you can opt to use the [XML Report Processing](xml-report-processing.md) build feature, or manually configure reporting tests by means of [service messages](service-messages.md).

To be able to review test results in TeamCity, do the following:
1. In your build, set the path to the TeamCity Add-in to the system property `teamcity.dotnet.nunitaddin` (for MSBuild it would be `teamcity_dotnet_nunitaddin`), and add the version of NUnit at the end of this path. For example:
   * For NUnit 2.4.X, use `${teamcity.dotnet.nunitaddin}-2.4.X.dll` (for MSBuild: `$(teamcity_dotnet_nunitaddin)-2.4.X.dll`)   
   Example for NUnit 2.4.7: `NAnt: ${teamcity.dotnet.nunitaddin}-2.4.7.dll`, MSBuild: `$(teamcity_dotnet_nunitaddin)-2.4.7.dll`
   * For NUnit 2.5.0 alpha 4, use `${teamcity.dotnet.nunitaddin}-2.5.0.dll` (for MSBuild: `$(teamcity_dotnet_nunitaddin)-2.5.0.dll`)
2. Copy the `.dll` and `.pdb` TeamCity add-in files to the NUnit add-in directory.

<note>

Although you can copy these files once, it is highly recommended configuring your builds so that the TeamCity add-in files are copied to the NUnit addin directory for __each build__, because these files could be updated by TeamCity.
</note>

The following example shows how to use the NUnit console runner with the TeamCity Add-in for NUnit 2.4.7 (on MSBuild):


```XML
<ItemGroup>
  <NUnitAddinFiles Include="$(teamcity_dotnet_nunitaddin)-2.4.7.*" />
</ItemGroup>
 
<Target Name="RunTests">
  <MakeDir Directories="$(NUnitHome)/bin/addins" />
  <Copy SourceFiles="@(NUnitAddinFiles)" DestinationFolder="$(NUnitHome)/bin/addins" />
  <Exec Command="$(NUnitHome)/bin/NUnit-Console.exe $(NUnitFileName)" />
</Target>

```



### Important Notes

__NUnit 2.4.8 Issue__

NUnit 2.4.8 has the following known issue: NUnit 2.4.8 runner tries to load an assembly according to the created `AssemblyName` object; however, the `addins` folder of NUnit 2.4.8 is not included in application probe paths. Thus NUnit 2.4.8 fails to load any add-in in the console mode.   
To solve the problem, we suggest you use any of the following workarounds:
* copy the TeamCity add-in assembly both to the NUnit `bin` and `bin/addins` folders
* patch `NUnit-Console.exe.config` to include the add-ins to application probe paths. Add the following code into the `config/runtime` element:


```XML
<assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
      <probing privatePath="addins"/>
</assemblyBinding>

```



See original blog post on this issue [http://nunit.com/blogs/?p=56](http://nunit.com/blogs/?p=56)

__Environment variables__ If you need to configure environment variables for NUnit explicitly, specify an environment variable with the value reference of `%\system.teamcity.dotnet.nunitaddin%`. See [Configuring Build Parameters](configuring-build-parameters.md) for details.
