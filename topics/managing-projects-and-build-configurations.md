[Projects](project.md) and their entities in TeamCity can be configured:
* via the web UI
* using the [REST API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest/teamcity-rest-api-documentation.html)
* programmatically using DSL based on the Kotlin language if the [versioned settings](storing-project-settings-in-version-control.md) feature is enabled

Refer to the sidebar for the list of detailed instructions on managing projects and build configurations in TeamCity.
